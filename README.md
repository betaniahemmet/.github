## Featured Projects

As technology becomes more evolved and society in it self becomes more complex, we come to rely more on technology to simplify our daily lives. Technology seamlessly integrates into the fabric of our daily routines, transforming the way we communicate, work, and navigate the world. One can view technology as the catalyst that propels us toward new realms of innovation and interconnectedness but for most of us technology is just a support to remind us through alarms, orginize our days through shared calendars or guide us through interactive maps. At the same time this evolution poses some challenges, especially for people with disabilities. When society takes for granted that we can use technology to perform certain tasks, those tasks might be hard or impossible to perform without technology. And technology is not always built to be inclusive to every and all, sometimes it requires fine motor skills or an understanding of a high level of abstraction.

So technology is a support and a crutch but at the same time it poses a challenge. <br>
If technology poses too much of a challenge it might even be viewed as a threat.

How can we make technology accesible to more people so that it can enable them to do more instead of hinder them from reaping the fruits of modern society?
