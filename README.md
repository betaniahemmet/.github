## About Technology

As technology becomes more evolved and society in it self becomes more complex, we come to rely more on technology to simplify our daily lives. Technology seamlessly integrates into the fabric of our daily routines, transforming the way we communicate, work, and navigate the world.

One can view technology as the catalyst that propels us toward further innovation and interconnectedness but for most of us technology is just a support to remind us through alarms, organize our days through shared calendars or guide us through interactive maps. Even simple pleasures as listening to music or reading the newspaper requires a fairly high technological competense today. At the same time this evolution poses some challenges, especially for people with disabilities. When society takes for granted that we can use technology to perform certain tasks, those tasks might be hard or impossible to perform without technology. And technology is not always built to be inclusive to every and all, sometimes it requires fine motor skills or an understanding of a high level of abstraction.

So technology is a support and a crutch but at the same time it poses a challenge. <br>
If technology poses too much of a challenge it might even be viewed as a threat.

How can we make technology accesible to more people so that it can enable them to do more instead of hinder them from reaping the fruits of modern technology?
It is indeed a question of democracy and perhaps even more important, of the quality of daily life for people who can not even use the most basic of digital tools.

## About Welfare Technology

Wellfare technology might mean many things. Just as technology plays a part in almost any modern human activity, welfare technology has come to have an almost infinite spectrum of possible applications of which most are still waiting to be invented. The ever increasing speed of progress in other areas risk to leave wellfare tech behind, due to the inertia of thought concerning the nature and procedure of traditional product development. In fact, most companies are struggling to adapt to this speeding new reality where whole systems are obsolete before they are even a finished product. The business of developing technical/digital tools or assistive aids are inescapably limited, since they have made it their business to cater not the many but the few and the effect of this is also effecting the agility of developing digital wellfare solutions. Often there is even higher requirements for safety standards and controls for developing wellfare tech than other tech, which is fair to say the least, but this also serves as a dampener and a hindrance to keep wellfare tech up to speed. 

One example (albeit extreme) of when this inertia has caused frustration is when the development of of automated insulin dosing systems were so slow that sleep deprived parents of kids with type 1 diabetes started to make their own artificial pancreases.

When working in a daily activities center one might be faced with easier tasks than recreating bodily organs, but they might as well be as difficult to achieve due to the seemingly complex nature of modern technology. Casette tapes are nowadays considered obsolete due to the digital alternatives that spotify now dominates. Still, casette players are more common in daily activities centers than in other places, partly due to the clunky inuitivity and durable, oversized controlls of these archaic beasts but also as a result of the fragile, fiddly and finicky phones and and laptops that are required to use spotify alltogether. Yet, many (in daily activities centers as well as in other settings) claim that music (and the ability to choose which music and at which time to listen) is of utmost importance in their life. We ought to make it easy for people to enjoy music.

## Vision

Product development cycles are accelerating rapidly in the wake of the exploding popularity and general availability of AI for programming, 3d-printing for decentralized manufacturing and cheap, handy development boards like the raspberry pi and the different esp32 boards. This is especially true about the do-it-yourself scene but could as easily be said about everything from the military to any of the abundant tech start ups.
