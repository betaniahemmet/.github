## About Us

Betaniahemmet is a non-profit organization that has been serving the community in Gothenburg for over a hundred years. The association is dedicated to providing services for individuals with differing abilities and special needs. This page is a part of Betaniahemmets aim to be at the fore front of welfare tech.

## About Technology

As technology becomes more evolved and society in it self becomes more complex, we come to rely more on technology to simplify our daily lives. Technology seamlessly integrates into the fabric of our daily routines, transforming the way we communicate, work, and navigate the world.

One can view technology as the catalyst that propels us toward further innovation and interconnectedness but for most of us technology is just a support to remind us through alarms, organize our days through shared calendars or guide us through interactive maps. Even simple pleasures as listening to music or reading the newspaper requires a fairly high technological competence today. At the same time this evolution poses some challenges, especially for people with disabilities. When society takes for granted that we can use technology to perform certain tasks, those tasks might be hard or impossible to perform without technology. And technology is not always built to be inclusive to every and all, sometimes it requires fine motor skills or an understanding of a high level of abstraction.

So technology is a support and a crutch but at the same time it poses a challenge.
If technology poses too much of a challenge it might even be viewed as a threat.

How can we make technology accessible to more people so that it can enable them to do more instead of hinder them from reaping the fruits of modern technology?
It is indeed a question of democracy and perhaps even more important, of the quality of daily life for people who might not be able to use complex digital tools.

## About Welfare Technology

Welfare technology might mean many things. Just as technology plays a part in almost any modern human activity, welfare technology has come to have an almost infinite spectrum of possible applications of which most are still waiting to be invented. The ever increasing speed of progress in other areas risk to leave welfare tech behind, due to the inertia of thought concerning the nature and procedure of traditional product development. In fact, most companies are struggling to adapt to this speeding new reality where whole systems are obsolete before they are even a finished product. The business of developing technical/digital tools or assistive aids are inescapably limited, since they have made it their business to cater not the many but the few and the effect of this is also effecting the agility of developing digital welfare solutions. Often there is even higher requirements for safety standards and controls for developing welfare tech than other tech, which is fair to say the least, but this also serves as a dampener and a hindrance to keep welfare tech up to speed. 

One example (albeit extreme) of when this inertia has caused frustration is when the development of of automated insulin dosing systems were so slow that sleep deprived parents of kids with type 1 diabetes started to make their own artificial pancreases.

When working in a daily activities center one might be faced with easier tasks than recreating bodily organs, but they might as well be as difficult to achieve due to the seemingly complex nature of modern technology. Cassette tapes are nowadays considered obsolete due to the digital alternatives that spotify now dominates. Still, cassette players are more common in daily activities centers than in other places, partly due to the clunky intuitivity and durable, over-sized controls of these archaic beasts but also as a result of the fragile, fiddly and finicky phones and and laptops that are required to use spotify altogether. Yet, many (in daily activities centers as well as in other settings) claim that music (and the ability to choose which music and at which time to listen) is of utmost importance in their life. We ought to make it easy for people to enjoy music.

## Vision

Product development cycles are accelerating rapidly in the wake of the exploding popularity and general availability of AI for programming, 3d-printing for decentralized manufacturing and cheap, handy development boards like the raspberry pi and the different esp32 boards. This is especially true about the do-it-yourself scene but could as easily be said about everything from the military to any of the abundant tech start ups.

The example of the artificial pancreas above is not only an illustration of frustration but also a showcase of the possibilities in open source development. It demonstrates how collaboration can drive innovation and rapid development, the cost-effectiveness of this approach, and ultimately underscores the substantial gain that stands to be realized for the people in need of this development.

If we could harness the advantages of the techniques above to address the need for new welfare tech, this might indeed transform the way we perceive and approach the entire field of welfare technology.
Collaboration and community, combined forces of private actors and the public sector, this should be corner stones in the future development of welfare tech.

It doesn't presuppose anything beyond the platform on which we currently engage -GitHub- and the ideas, or even just the notion of a need that could be fulfilled if addressed by a community of people, whether programmers or not.

The boundaries of the definition of welfare tech is not really clearly defined. It could encompass projects like sensors, for example, to measure sound amplitude and databases designed to collect and store data to be able to make data driven decisions. Additionally it may involve bluetooth buttons or specialized keyboards to simplify input or enable easy control of programs and apps. Welfare tech could also include the development of specialized apps designed to organize the workday for personnel or participants, or an app designed for teaching sign language. Furthermore it extends to both hardware or software solutions, including STL-files for 3d printing or SVG-files for laser cutting.

The needs in one daily activities center or a group home is likely the same as those in other centers or homes, even at opposite ends of the world and there is no gain in reinventing the wheel. 


## Repositories

As of now we have some projects in various states of completion that anyone is more than welcome to take a look at, clone, improve, fork or simply discuss. Some are highly specialized while others have a very general application in mind. 

### [Big Bluetooth Media Buttons](https://github.com/betaniahemmet/big-ble-buttons.git)
- A shot at designing an array of three buttons to control e.g. Spotify.
- Easy to connect to tablets and phones. Easy to handle due to big arcade buttons.
- STL-files, Arduino code and instructions.

### [Sound Amplitude Logger](https://github.com/betaniahemmet/soundlog.git)
- Log the sound amplitude in a room.
- Log the data, store the data, use the data.
- MEMS-microphone ICS-40180, Raspberry Pi Pico W, STL-files.

### [Sign-quiz](https://github.com/betaniahemmet/sign-quiz.git)
- A first look at a game for learning sign language.
- This ought to be packaged in some way, perhaps using Kivy. 
- One should make proper videos for this. 
- There is code for automatic video editing among other things that will be added soon.
